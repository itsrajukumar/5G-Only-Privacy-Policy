        <h1>5G Only</h1>
        <p>Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Use</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 13, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>Raju Kumar</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") built the <strong>5G Only</strong> app as a free, ad-supported application. This service is provided by Raju Kumar at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <p>This page explains how the app collects, uses, and protects information when you use the service.</p>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>The app itself does not require you to create an account or directly submit personal information such as your name, email, or address. Any settings or preferences you change in the app are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.</p>
        <p>The app uses third-party services that may collect certain identifiers (such as Advertising ID, device information, or crash logs) to show ads, measure usage, and improve stability.</p>

        <h3>Permissions We Request</h3>

        <div class="permission-box">
            <span class="permission-title">📱 Phone State &amp; Modify Phone State</span>
            Used to read basic network information (for example, current network type and capabilities) and to open or trigger system network settings screens that allow you to change preferred network type (such as 5G/NR where supported by your device and carrier).
        </div>

        <div class="permission-box">
            <span class="permission-title">📍 Location (Access Fine/Coarse Location)</span>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The app does not track or store your physical location. On recent versions of Android, approximate or precise location permission is required by the system to read radio and cell information used for showing network signal details and nearby cell information.
        </div>

        <div class="permission-box">
            <span class="permission-title">🌐 Internet &amp; Network State</span>
            Used to check whether the device is online, detect the current connection type, and display real-time network usage information (such as download/upload speed) inside the app.
        </div>

        <div class="permission-box">
            <span class="permission-title">🔔 Post Notifications (Android 13+)</span>
            Used to show important informational notifications from the app, such as reminders related to network mode or general app updates. You can disable notifications at any time from your device settings.
        </div>

        <div class="permission-box">
            <span class="permission-title">📢 Advertising ID</span>
            Used by Google AdMob to display relevant ads that support the development and maintenance of this free app. You can reset or limit ad personalization from your Google account or device settings.
        </div>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device. You can review their privacy policies at the links below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Log Data &amp; Security</h3>
        <p>In case of an error or crash, the app may send technical information (such as device model, Android version, and stack traces) to Firebase Crashlytics. This data is used only to diagnose problems and improve stability.</p>
        <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to help protect this data, but no method of transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

        <h3>Data Sharing &amp; Retention</h3>
        <p>Personal data is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Data handled by third-party services (such as Google or Firebase) is subject to their own retention and processing policies.</p>
        <p>If you wish to limit data collection, you can use platform controls such as ad personalization settings, location permissions, and app permission controls in your device settings.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

        <p>By downloading or using the app, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you should stop using and uninstall the app.</p>

        <p>You are not allowed to copy, modify, reverse engineer, or redistribute the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks, except where permitted by applicable law or with prior written permission from <strong>Raju Kumar</strong>. All rights, title, and interest in and to the app and its content remain with <strong>Raju Kumar</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Service &amp; Liability</h3>
        <p>The goal of the app is to provide convenient access to network-related information and system settings. The app is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any express or implied warranties regarding accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

        <p><strong>Important note on network settings:</strong> The app may provide shortcuts or methods to open hidden or advanced network settings (for example, forcing 5G/NR-only modes where supported). Changing these settings can affect call quality, data connectivity, SMS delivery, and emergency calling behavior. By using these features, you accept full responsibility for any missed calls, messages, data loss, or connectivity issues while such modes are active.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for ensuring that any changes you make comply with your mobile carrier’s terms, local regulations, and the capabilities of your device.</p>

        <h3>Updates, Changes, and Termination</h3>
        <p>The app may be updated from time to time to add features, fix bugs, or comply with policy and legal requirements. Some updates may be automatic via Google Play or your app store of choice.</p>
        <p>These Privacy Policy and Terms &amp; Conditions may also be updated periodically. You are encouraged to review this page from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are posted will be considered acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app is not specifically targeted at children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has used the app in a way that shares personal data, you can contact us for further information.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about this Privacy Policy or the Terms &amp; Conditions, you can contact the developer at:</p>
